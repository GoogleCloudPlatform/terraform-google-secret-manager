# Monitoring Alerting Secret

This test example creates a secret on Secret Manager,
monitors it and send notifications via email when a secret version is destroyed.
Has a notification rate limit of 5 minutes i.e. if two secrets are deleted
in less than 5 minutes only one notification will be sent.

## Requirements

No requirements.

## Note

If you manage any sensitive data with Terraform (like database passwords,
user passwords, or private keys), treat the state itself as sensitive data.
Storing state remotely can provide better security.
